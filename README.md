# ChicagoBusTracker
A program that tracks all of Chicago's buses and calculates a lot of information on them.

One of the first programs I ever wrote was this. I wanted to come back and completely rewrite it and see how much I've improved and how my approach to the problem has changed.

Setup:
  Open up Google Earth and 'Add' a 'Network Link' under 'My Places' and put the path to 'TrackKML.kml' in the Link field.
  
Set the refresh tab to 'Periodically' and a low refresh rate. Make sure the checkbox next to the Network Link is check then run 'tracker.py'.

It's updating once every 30 seconds to keep from spamming their servers.
